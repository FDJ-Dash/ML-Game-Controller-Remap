## How does it work?
- The App will detect your device and remap its commands to a keyboard equivalent execution which is read from the ML_GameControllerRemap.ini file.
- You get to choose the game mode, and adapt to a kind of camera rotation that the game allows.
- You can also modify the ini file to match your specific game needs.
